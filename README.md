# DS_Catch_Testing_Framework
Demo for Data Structures discussion section of using the Catch testing framework for C++.

Makefile is included to run example tests.
Available make tasks:
* `make` : run all tests
* `make alltestsv` : run all tests with verbose output
* `make testaddnode` : runs tests for addition node
* `make testdivnode` : runs tests for division node

By default, one of the division node tests will fail. This is used as an example of a failing test and to demonstrate
making test cases appropriate for specific classes.

**Requires the g++ compiler**
